Sector Crescent is a fork of [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), our homegrown engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for Sector Crescent

If you want to host or create content for SC, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs.
