	• As this is primarily a roleplaying server, you will undoubtedly come into situations where your character might have to be antagonistic, rude, or otherwise unpleasant to be around. Please ensure that this only applies to your character and not yourself. We're all here to have fun or something.

[color=#a4885c][head=3]Erotic roleplay scenes are not permitted on Sector Crescent.[/head][/color]
	• This isn't due to a draconic enforcement of WizardHub policy. This rule was voted on and we determined that erotic roleplay did not contribute much to the IC world. Your character might be married, have an ongoing relationship, or be family members with another character, but you are not permitted to actually ERP while ingame. Take it to your Discord DM's, buddy.

[color=#a4885c][head=3]Minutemen, New League Homeguard and other command, high-risk roles are held to higher standards.[/head][/color]
	• Such high-profile roles are what makes the Story tick. With elevated permissions, comes elevated scrutiny. You might find that what you get away with as a Pioneer, you won't get away with as the General Secretary.

[color=#a4885c][head=3]Try to roleplay your best.[/head][/color]
	• Roleplay your best. Use proper grammar and punctuation. Act as your character would. Not like you would, the person behind the screen.
