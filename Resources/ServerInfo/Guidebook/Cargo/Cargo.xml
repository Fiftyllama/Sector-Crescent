  # Cargo and Supply
  Shinohara Heavy Industries, more commonly known simply as SHI, is in charge of keeping the system stocked up on necessary resources, such as fuel and raw materials. Though, they are not restricted to simple goods, and can order a wide variety of different items from off-system. The point is, it's SHI's job to get the rest of the station what they need.

  ## Ordering
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerCargoOrders"/>
  </Box>
  Every transaction you make will begin at a [color=#a4885c]cargo request computer[/color], from which you can make orders for specific products. Making any order requires [color=#118C4F]credits[/color], the currency of the Sector. To make an order, click the "request" button next to whatever you need, type an appropriate reason for why you're ordering it, and hit "approve" when it appears below the request list.

  ## Piloting
  Orders are shipped to the station via the [color=#a4885c]Freeport[/color], and then transported with cargo shuttles by cargo pilots.

 # After clicking the computer, you should see a radar view of the shuttle. Here are the steps for piloting the shuttle back and forth:
#
 # - First, disconnect any airlocks that are connected to the dock.
  #- Then, you actually get to pilot the shuttle. The controls are fairly simple, with [color=#028ed9]"W"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"S"[/color] being forward and backward, [color=#028ed9]"A"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"D"[/color] being left and right, and [color=#028ed9]"Q"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"E"[/color] being rotating left and right; and [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] being the brake and moving precicely by holding the [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] while doing other inputs.
  #- Then pilot the shuttle to the [textlink="Trade Station" link="TradeStation"].

  ## Selling
  So, you want to order something, but don't have the money for it? You just need to sell something. A lot of things in the system has economic value, which an [color=#a4885c]appraisal tool[/color] can read out to you.

  After finding something worth selling, place it on the cargo pallet, and click 'sell' on the appropriate console. You can make even more with salaries from your station-based jobs, or other space-based employment opportunities like asteorid mining, privateering, and exploration.
